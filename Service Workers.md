# 🔧 Service Workers

## Overview
⚙️ **Service Workers** are scripts that run in the background, separate from web pages, enabling features like offline functionality, background sync, and push notifications. They act as a proxy between your web app and the network.

## Key Characteristics
- 🔄 **Background Processing**: Run independently of web pages
- 📶 **Network Proxy**: Intercept and handle network requests
- 💾 **Persistent**: Continue running even when browser tabs are closed
- 🔒 **Secure**: Require HTTPS (except localhost)
- ⚡ **Event-Driven**: Respond to specific events and lifecycle changes

## How Service Workers Work
1. **Registration**: Web page registers the service worker
2. **Installation**: Browser downloads and installs the script
3. **Activation**: Service worker takes control of pages
4. **Event Handling**: Responds to fetch, push, sync events

## Prerequisites
- [[JavaScript Fundamentals]] - Async/await, promises, event handling
- [[HTTP Protocol]] - Understanding requests and responses
- [[Browser APIs]] - Web platform interfaces
- [[Progressive Web Apps]] - Context and use cases

## Core Events

### Installation Event
```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  // Cache resources during installation
});
```

### Activation Event
```javascript
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  // Clean up old caches, take control
});
```

### Fetch Event
```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  // Intercept network requests
});
```

## Main Use Cases

### Offline Functionality
- Cache resources with [[Cache API]]
- Serve cached content when offline
- Implement [[Offline-First Strategy]]

### Background Sync
- Queue actions when offline with [[Background Sync API]]
- Retry failed requests when connection returns
- Sync data in the background

### Push Notifications
- Receive [[Push Notifications]] when app is closed
- Handle notification clicks and actions
- Manage notification permissions

## Service Worker Lifecycle
1. **Registration** → [[Service Worker Registration]]
2. **Installation** → [[Service Worker Installation]]
3. **Waiting** → [[Service Worker Updates]]
4. **Activation** → [[Service Worker Activation]]
5. **Redundant** → [[Service Worker Cleanup]]

## Caching Strategies
- 🏠 [[Cache First]] - Serve from cache, fallback to network
- 🌐 [[Network First]] - Try network first, fallback to cache
- ⚡ [[Cache Only]] - Only serve from cache
- 🔄 [[Network Only]] - Only serve from network
- 🎯 [[Stale While Revalidate]] - Serve cache, update in background

## Common Patterns
- [[Application Shell Architecture]] - Cache app shell separately
- [[Runtime Caching]] - Cache resources as they're requested
- [[Precaching]] - Cache essential resources during installation
- [[Cache Management]] - Efficient storage strategies

## Tools and Libraries
- 🧰 [[Workbox]] - Google's service worker library
- 🔍 [[Chrome DevTools]] - Debug and inspect service workers
- 🛠️ [[PWA Builder]] - Generate service worker code
- 📊 [[Service Worker Inspector]] - Monitor service worker activity

## Debugging and Testing
- [[Service Worker Debugging]] - Chrome DevTools techniques
- [[Offline Testing]] - Simulate network conditions
- [[Update Testing]] - Handle service worker updates
- [[Error Handling]] - Graceful failure strategies

## Best Practices
- Keep service workers lightweight
- Handle updates gracefully with [[Service Worker Updates]]
- Implement proper [[Error Handling]]
- Use [[Cache Management]] to avoid storage bloat
- Test offline scenarios thoroughly

## Limitations and Considerations
- Cannot access DOM directly
- Limited to HTTPS (production)
- Browser support varies for advanced features
- Complex debugging compared to regular scripts
